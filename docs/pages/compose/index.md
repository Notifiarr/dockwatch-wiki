!!! warning
    This feature is still a work in progress on everything it will be able to do

## Current usage

Currently you can store compose files locally with Dockwatch so that you can pull or create stacks from the interface instead of having to use the shell for everything

## Future usage

In the future there are plans to make Dockwatch much smarter about how it can utilize compose files. This will allow it to properly pull and create conainers via the compose mechanism instead of the docker api
