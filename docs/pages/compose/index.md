!!! warning
    This feature is a work in progress and not yet fully implemented.

## Current usage

Dockwatch can store Docker Compose files locally, allowing you to pull or create stacks from the UI instead of using the shell.

## Future usage

Planned improvements will let Dockwatch use Compose files more intelligently, enabling it to pull and create containers via the Compose workflow rather than directly through the Docker API.
