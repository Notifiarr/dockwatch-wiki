Use this modal to create groups and organize the container table.

You can create any number of groups and assign each container to a single group. If a container is already assigned to another group, its row will not show a checkbox and the `Existing Group` column will display its current group.

To remove or change a container’s group, select the group from the dropdown, uncheck the container, and save. That will unassign the container so you can move it to a different group or leave it ungrouped.
