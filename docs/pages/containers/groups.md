This modal will allow you to group similar containers and organize the container table

You can add as many groups as you like and then assign containers to them. One container can be assigned to one group at a time which means if a container is already in another group then the list will not have a checkbox next to the container and the `Existing Group` column will show which group that container belongs to.

If you want to remove a container from a group or change its group, load the group from the group drop down and uncheck it and save. This will unassign its group and allow you to move it to another group or leave it ungrouped.
