## Crons

You can choose to disable crons you dont want to run although there really is no need to do this and can cause other issues if they can not run on schedule

If you want to trigger a cron to run right now, click the hourglass icon next to it and you will see the output in the panel to the right

## Files

If you need to view a file and do not want to open it on disk, you can view them here. This is mainly used for troubleshooting purposes as well
