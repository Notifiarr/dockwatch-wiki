If you utilize docker swarm, this can still be used.

1. Install Dockwatch on each of the swarm nodes
2. Pick whichever instance you want to be your "main" instance
3. Get the url and apikey from each node instance and add them to the [servers](/pages/settings/servers) section in the settings

Now you will have a drop down menu above the navigation that allows you to hop between each Dockwatch instance and control each one from a single interface
