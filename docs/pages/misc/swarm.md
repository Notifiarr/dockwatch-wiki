Dockwatch works in Swarm environments.

1. Install Dockwatch on each of the swarm nodes
2. Pick whichever instance you want to be your "main" instance
3. Get the url and API key from each node instance and add them to the [servers](/pages/settings/servers) section in the settings

Each node will now appear under the [Servers](/#servers) tab. From there you can select any instance and manage it from the same Web UI.
