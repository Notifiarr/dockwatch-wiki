I would suggest if you have not already, you create an integration specific key for Dockwatch in your profile on the Notifiarr site.

Once you have the apikey, click the + for the Notifiarr platform and add your apikey to it and enable the triggers you want to send to Notifiarr. On the Notifiarr site setup the channels, etc for the notifications

You can opt to send the same triggers to multiple Notifiarr accounts via different apikeys as well
