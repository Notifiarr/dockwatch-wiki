You will need to create a bot in Telegram via the Godfather bot to obtain a Telegram bot token. If you already have one, you can use that as well. Once you do that you will need to get the chat_id for the channel you want to send the notifications to. There is documentation on how to do this online but the one I used for testing was a [gist](https://gist.github.com/nafiesl/4ad622f344cd1dc3bb1ecbe468ff9f8a#get-chat-id-for-a-channel){:target="_blank"} on Github

After you have the token and the chat_id you can add them to the platform and receive notifications
